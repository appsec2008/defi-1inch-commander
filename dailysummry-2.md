# Daily Summary #2 - Project Development

This document summarizes the key development activities and improvements made during our second major session, focusing on API correctness, major feature upgrades, and enhanced debugging.

### Key Achievements:

1.  **Codebase Stabilization**: We began by rolling back the codebase to a previous stable state to resolve a persistent "Maximum update depth exceeded" rendering loop, providing a clean foundation for subsequent fixes.

2.  **Fixed Portfolio Balance Logic with 1inch Balance API**: We successfully integrated the correct 1inch Balance API (`/balance/v1.2/.../balances`) to fetch user portfolio data. This multi-step fix involved:
    *   **Correcting the Endpoint**: Initially using the wrong API, we switched to the correct `v1.2` balance checker endpoint.
    *   **Including Native ETH**: We resolved a critical bug where the native ETH balance was missing by adding a specific API call to fetch it and merging it with the ERC-20 token list.
    *   **Eliminating "Unknown Token" Errors**: We fixed a bug where less common tokens were not being identified. We replaced a call to fetch only popular tokens with a comprehensive fetch of all tokens on the chain, ensuring all assets in a user's wallet are displayed correctly.

3.  **Upgraded Token Swap to 1inch Fusion API**: The core token swapping functionality was completely overhauled to use the modern 1inch Fusion API.
    *   **Switched to Fusion Quoter**: We replaced the old quote logic with calls to the `/fusion-plus/quoter/v1.0/quote/receive` endpoint.
    *   **Implemented Presets**: The UI was redesigned to display the `fast`, `medium`, and `slow` swap presets returned by the Fusion API, giving users more control over their transactions.

4.  **Refactored AI Risk Assessment Prompt**: The AI prompt logic was re-architected to be more robust and informative.
    *   **Resolved Build Errors**: We moved the prompt template out of the "use server" file and into a server action (`src/app/actions.ts`) to fix critical build errors.
    *   **Improved Prompt Clarity**: The prompt sent to the AI was updated to include clear, descriptive headers for each JSON data block (Portfolio, History, etc.), explaining the purpose of the data to the LLM.

5.  **Enhanced API Debugging and Transparency**: To improve development and debugging, we added significant visibility into the application's API calls.
    *   **Request & Response Cards**: The API display cards were updated to show both the full `request` object and the `response` object, providing clear insight into API interactions.
    *   **Instant Quote Debugging**: We added a popup dialog to the Token Swap component that automatically appears whenever a new "From" token is selected, showing the raw request and response for the Fusion API call in real-time.
