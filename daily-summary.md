# Daily Summary - Project Development

This document summarizes the key development activities and improvements made during our recent session.

### Key Achievements:

1.  **Corrected API Key Logic**: We started by fixing the core logic to ensure the application uses the correct API keys (`1inch`, `Moralis`) for the appropriate functions. This involved updating the services and the main page to check for the presence of these keys.

2.  **Secured Environment Variable Checks**: We identified and fixed a security flaw where the app was trying to access a server-side `MORALIS_API_KEY` on the client. We implemented a more secure pattern by using a public-facing flag (`NEXT_PUBLIC_MORALIS_API_KEY_IS_CONFIGURED`) to inform the UI that the key is configured on the server without exposing the key itself.

3.  **Switched to a Light Theme**: We modified the CSS in `globals.css` and removed the `dark` class from the main layout file to give the application a clean, light theme with a white background and black text.

4.  **Resolved `next/image` Configuration Errors**: We debugged and fixed multiple runtime errors caused by the `next/image` component. This was resolved by adding the required image source hostnames (`logo.moralis.io`, `cdn.moralis.io`, `deep-index.moralis.io`) to the `next.config.ts` file.

5.  **Enhanced Portfolio Calculation**: We significantly improved the portfolio logic. The application now correctly fetches and includes the native ETH balance alongside the ERC-20 tokens, ensuring the total portfolio value is accurate and complete.

6.  **Increased API Transparency**: To make it easier to debug and understand the data flow, we added new UI cards to display the full JSON responses from the Moralis API for both portfolio balances and token prices.

7.  **Fixed API Price Fetching**: We diagnosed and fixed a critical "Not Found" error from the Moralis price endpoint. We corrected the `fetch` call by changing it from a `GET` to a `POST` request and sending the required token addresses in the request body, which is the correct method for this API.
